		- Seek to help the client uncover their true needs.  Sometimes they do not need an automated solution, sometimes something manual will do just fine.  Often times they are so close to the situation they cannot step back and see the full picture.  We are all like that including myself.  As analytical people, developers can often ask the right questions because we need to know all the details in order to build a system (computers are not that smart).  Ask the why questions before the how and what questions.
		- Under promise and over deliver.  Seek to impress with words and sales-speak, but instead impress with attitude, honesty, actions and invaluable service.  You are after a long term relationship after all and that is built on trust and serving others.  You cannot promise something until you understand all the details, and you will never understand all the details until you are complete.
