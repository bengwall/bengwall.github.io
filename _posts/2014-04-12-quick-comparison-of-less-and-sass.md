I embarked on learning CSS pre-processors and wanted to pick the best one.  "Best" is always a mix of most powerful features and most popular.  (We're lucky if they are the same.)

After scouring the web, here what I have found:

- Sass is more popular
- Sass uses $ symbol instead of @ which Less uses (@ already has meaning in CSS)
- Sass supports inheritance of selectors.  Less does not.
- Sass has better looping capabilities
- Sass requires Ruby - It is coded in Ruby and processed server-side.
- Less is a JavaScript library and processed client-side.

Sass seems to edge out Less for me, so it's Sass for me.  Now to research related technology,... [Compass](http://compass-style.org).
