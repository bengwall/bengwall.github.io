## Description
Lo-Dash.js is a JavasScript library which provides utility functions for common JavaScript tasks.  It provides support for the functional constructs (each, map, reduce, filter...) without extending any core JavaScript objects.  

Some of these functional constructs are slowing making there way into the ECMA specifications, but they are at various stages of implementation across the browsers.  Lo-Dash provides abstractions that work everywhere.  If available, Lo-Dash falls back to native implementations.

## Reasons for Lo-Dash.js
* **Less Code:**  SPA and REST driven apps typically process many objects, arrays, and collections.  Lo-Dash provides functions to handle and manipulate these objects.  Lo-Dash can do these manipulations with less code.
* **Popularity:** [Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=underscorejs%2C%20lodash&cmpt=q)
* **MIT License:** [GITHUB code](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/blob/master/lodash.js)
* **Compact:** 28k
* **Active:** [GITHUB activity](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/graphs)
* **Quality:** [100% code coverage](http://lodash.com/), [GITHUB Issues](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues)
* **No Overlap:** It does not overlap with existing approved libraries
* The Restangular library for AngularJS is dependent on Lo-Dash (or Underscore).

## Examples
Below are some before and after examples.  Here are some [additional examples](http://lodash.com/docs).

#### Example #1
The following code...

```
scope.pageActionHandlers = {};
for(i=0;i <options.flows.length;i++){
	scope.pageActionHandlers[options.flows[i].name] = options.flows[i].handlers;
}
```

...can be written as...

```
scope.pageActionHandlers = {};
_.each(options.flows, function(flow) {
    scope.pageActionHandlers[flows.name] = flows.handlers;
});

// or better yet...
scope.pageActionHandlers = _.map(options.flows, function(flow){
    return {flow.name: flow.andlers};
});
                            .
```

#### Example #2
The following code...

```
// get first flow where flow.name = flowName
var foundFlow = undefined;
for(i=0;i<flows.length;i++){
    if(flows[i].name == flowName){
		foundFlow = flows[i];
	}
}
```

...can be written as...

```
var foundFlow = _.find(flows, function(flow) {
    return flow.name: flowName;
});

// or better yet...
var foundFlow = _.findWhere(flows, {name : flowName});
```
