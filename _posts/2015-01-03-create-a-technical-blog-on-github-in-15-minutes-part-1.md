I'm driven to efficiency.  Not only because my time is limited, but I want to share information, not do busy work.  So I like simple tools and practices.  I have seemingly researched the whole internet to determine the best method to efficiently create and quickly maintain a technical blog.  I think I found nearly the perfect solution.

To start with, I am a big fan in Markdown because of how simple it is to provide consistent  styling.  I boiled my choices to [Ghost](www.Ghost.org) and [BlogSpot](www.blogspot.com), both of which are powerful blogging engines which can use Markdown.  I also researched many online Markdown editor and by far my favorite was [StackEdit](www.stackedit.io) and as a bonus it integrates with BlogSpot.  (StackEdit has an awesome Markdown editor with a real-time preview pane.)  BlogSpot was also free, so my decision was made... almost.

Somehow I came across GitHub Pages, and it was awesome.  I'm in complete control because it just deals with files (no hidden database).  Blog posts are just files.  These files are in a GitHub repository so my files are backed by source control.  Can this get any simpler.

StackEdit does not integrate with GitHub, but I ran into the [Prose](www.prose.io) which does not have StackEdit awesome preview pane, but does have integration with GitHub.  (I'm writing in Prose now!)

After cleaning up my notes, I'll detail out the process in my next post.
